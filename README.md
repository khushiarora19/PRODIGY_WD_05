This project is a weather web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. It displays the current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information, providing users with up-to-date weather details. This project showcases how to integrate external APIs with web technologies to create a functional and interactive application.
